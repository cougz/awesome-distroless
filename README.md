# Awesome Distroless

Minimal, secure distroless Docker images built from scratch. Each service is self-contained and immediately deployable.

## Why Distroless?

Traditional container images include entire operating systems with hundreds of packages you'll never use. Every binary is a potential security risk. Distroless changes this completely.

**What's NOT in a distroless image:**
- ❌ No shell (`sh`, `bash`) - Can't spawn interactive shells
- ❌ No coreutils (`ls`, `cat`, `echo`, `mkdir`, `rm`) - Can't manipulate files
- ❌ No package manager (`apt`, `yum`, `apk`) - Can't install software
- ❌ No text editors (`vi`, `nano`) - Can't modify configs
- ❌ No network tools (`ping`, `netstat`, `ss`) - Can't probe network
- ❌ No process tools (`ps`, `top`, `kill`) - Can't inspect processes
- ❌ No system libraries beyond the absolute minimum

**Result:** Your application is the ONLY executable in the container. An attacker who gains access has no tools to establish persistence, explore the system, or download malware.
